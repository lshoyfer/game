# Game
Contains my dicking around with macroquad. Had fun.

Just commiting and making public whatever I was doing.

I mostly did a bunch of frameworking for a game; No actual "game" of substance was done yet.

I don't remember the exact state I left this in or what I was working on in detail. I think I was setting up fonts and expanding on the map parser.

Seems to not build due to something with either the map parser itself or the map file or both. Probably the map file -- maybe I left it in some purposely wrong state to test something.
